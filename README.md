HR_Analytics_PowerBI 💼
* I have created an HR dataset-based analytics dashboard 🧑‍💼📈.
* This dashboard focuses on various relations among the features of the dataset and how they contribute to effective analysis 🔍.
* I have also used DAX to create calculated measures and columns to enhance analytics 📉➕.
* Since the data comprises two tables, I utilized the data modeling feature of Power BI to relate these tables by creating a simple relationship using a unique key employee ID 🔗🆔
